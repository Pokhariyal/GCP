# GCP_Drive_GCS
Repo that contains code to automate data ingestion from Drive to GCS

I've written a code using Google APIs to automate the ingestion of data from Google Drive to GCS. 

If you're working on your local machine, use requirements_local.txt. To install this file, use `pip install -r requirements_local.txt`

If you're working on cloud function, use requirements_cloud.txt. The code has a couple of changes similarly. Highly recommend working locally since it takes about 6 mins for every run of a cloud function.

Hope this works for you like it did for me! :D
